agent_with_tools:
This project is aimed at exploring the use of Langchain Agents, a powerful natural language processing tool, with custom tools for a more tailored and efficient NLP solution. Langchain Agents is a state-of-the-art NLP tool that allows you to build, train, and deploy custom language models. By using Langchain Agents with custom tools, you can create an NLP solution that meets your specific requirements and performs the tasks you need it to.

More specifically, we created 6 custom tools:

- A SERP API Search Tool to use the SERP API to search the internet when the agent decides it is appropriate to do so
- A Wolfram Alpha calculations tool to do mathematical calculations
- A Task Creation tool to create a list of tasks using the GPT-3 API
- A Task Prioritisation tool to prioritise a list of tasks using the GPT-3 API
- A Task Execution tool to execute tasks using the GPT-3 API
- A Wolfram Alpha Knowledge Query tool to query facts from Wolfram Alpha's database (currently used for nutritional information)

foodGPTv1.8:
FoodGPT is a project that utilizes the power of the GPT-3 API to write R or SQL code to query a given food data source. It also connects to the Wolfram Alpha API to obtain information from Wolfram Alpha's extensive nutritional information database. With FoodGPT, users can quickly and easily search for nutritional information on any food item and obtain detailed information on the food's macronutrient and micronutrient content.
